We will likely have daily meetings or a few times a week. Date and time for the next meeting will be decided soon and will show up here and on discord.

## :clipboard: Tasks

We can try to use the "issues" tab in gitlab for tasks but for now this works

- [x] Look through both project specs
- [x] Look through the mark scheme
- [ ] Learn git (commits, branches, pull requests, issues etc.)
- [ ] Revise JavaFX, Maven etc.
- [x] Choose a project and submit [this](https://forms.gle/bKm9AQZipRkzfJBa6) form
- [ ] Get in touch with supervisor
